<h1>Cancer Prediction System</h1>
This project focuses on building a cancer prediction system using Python and machine learning techniques. By analyzing a dataset related to cancer diagnosis, we aim to create accurate predictions. Below are the key steps involved in this project:

<h1>Project Overview</h1>
Objective: Develop a machine learning model for cancer prediction.
Dataset: The dataset contains features related to cancer patients.
Approach: We’ll explore the data, preprocess it, build multiple models, and select the best-performing one.
<h1>Steps:</h1>
1.Data Loading and Exploration:
Load the dataset from the user’s folder.
Understand the dataset’s structure using statistical summaries and visualization.


2.Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values.
Update data types (e.g., convert to categorical).
Encode labels (e.g., diagnosis).

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize correlations.
Create heatmaps.
Generate box plots and distribution plots.

4.Model Building
Implement machine learning models:
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest Classifier
XGBoost Classifier
Fine-tune model hyperparameters.

5.Feature Selection
Identify important features using feature importance scores.
Select top features for model training.

6.Balancing the Data
Address class imbalance using oversampling techniques.

7.Model Evaluation
Evaluate model performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Compare models and choose the best.

8.Deployment and Production
Save the trained model using pickle.
Deploy the prediction system.
